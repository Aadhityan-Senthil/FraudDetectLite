# FraudDetectLite

## Overview
**FraudDetectLite** is a mini-project designed for **credit card fraud detection** using machine learning techniques. The model predicts fraudulent transactions from a given dataset, helping identify potential fraud in real-time payment systems. This project leverages historical credit card transaction data to detect anomalies and suspicious activities.

## Project Description
**FraudDetectLite** uses machine learning to predict fraudulent credit card transactions. By applying various classification algorithms, the model is able to differentiate between legitimate and fraudulent transactions. The project is ideal for understanding the basic workflow of fraud detection, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

### Features:
- **Fraud Detection**: Identifies fraudulent transactions from a given dataset.
- **Model Evaluation**: Implements accuracy metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Real-time Predictions**: Can be used with new datasets for fraud prediction.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language for implementing machine learning algorithms and data preprocessing.
- **Scikit-learn**: Library used for building the machine learning model.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: For data visualization and plotting.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Development environment for running the model and experimentation.

## Installation Instructions
To run **FraudDetectLite** locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aadhityan-Senthil/FraudDetectLite.git
   cd FraudDetectLite
   ```

2. Install dependencies using `requirements.txt`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ensure you have **Jupyter Notebook** or **VS Code** installed to run the notebook:
   - Install Jupyter Notebook: `pip install notebook`
   - Or, install VS Code with the Python extension.

## Usage
Once the environment is set up, open the Jupyter notebook file `CCFDproject.ipynb` to execute the code.

To run the model, use the following steps:

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
2. Load the dataset, either the existing one or a new dataset.
3. Train the model using the provided code, which includes:
   - Data preprocessing
   - Model training and evaluation
   - Prediction of fraudulent transactions

Example code to load and use the dataset:

```python
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv('path/to/your/dataset.csv')

# Load the trained model and make predictions
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is available at [Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). It contains credit card transaction data, including both legitimate and fraudulent transactions.

- **Dataset Features**:
  - Time: The time elapsed between the transaction and the first transaction.
  - Amount: The purchase amount for the transaction.
  - V1-V28: Anonymized features resulting from PCA transformation.
  - Class: Indicates whether the transaction is fraudulent (1) or not (0).
